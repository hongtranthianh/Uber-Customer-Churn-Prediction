## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
- Beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python, there are ... libraries needed to be installed:
- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Currently using `Python 3.11.3` on `Windowns 11`.

## 2. Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
**Ride-hailing** is an on-demand transportation service that provides an efficient travel mode by matching drivers and travelers via smartphone apps. This industry is very dynamic and gives its customers lots of choices. However, customers become more knowledgeable and less patient nowadays, which easily leads them to switch to competitors (aka **customer churn**)

To meet the need of surviving in this competitive industry, the retention of existing customers becomes a huge challenge. Because retaining an existing customer is a much lower cost than acquiring a new customer, this project will use Uber data to propose a prediction model that detects who is likely to churn in a specific period in order to have a better strategy for customer retention.
